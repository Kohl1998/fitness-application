# Jiu Jitsu Application

## Description

This is a single page application built using reactJS, and emailJS for handling form submissions.

My motivation for this project comes from my passion for martial arts, as I believe everyone should learn self-defence. 

During the process I found challenges in finding a variety of api's based around the UFC. Howevever, I managed to find one by the 'Fighting Tomatoes', which gave me data back in JSON format (in an array) which I struggled to convert to a normal object and map over.

## Installation

For this application I initialised a new project with the npx create-react-app command on Gitbash terminal. 

To run this application locally, you can clone the repo. However ensure you install all dependacies by running npm install.
